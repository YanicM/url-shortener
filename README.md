# url-shortener

This is a simple script for creating a URL shortening service. I haven't implemented a real interface yet.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Python 3 installed.

## Testing

I still need to run some tests for validating URLs.

## Deployment

If you want to run the URL shortener locally, just start the url-shortener.py script and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Otherwise you could probably deploy it to PythonAnywhere, Heroku, etc.
